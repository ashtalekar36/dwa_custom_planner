This repository contains a **custom Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) local planner** implementation for a differential-drive robot (TurtleBot3) in ROS 2 Humble. It includes a full simulation in **Gazebo**, obstacle avoidance using **LaserScan**, goal-driven velocity sampling, and trajectory visualization in **RViz**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Implements DWA algorithm from scratch in Python
- ✅ Obstacle avoidance using `/scan` topic
- ✅ Goal-oriented trajectory sampling
- ✅ Smoothness and velocity cost evaluation
- ✅ Marker-based trajectory visualization in RViz
- ✅ Simulated TurtleBot3 in a custom Gazebo world
- ✅ Compatible with SLAM and Nav2 parameters

## 🧩 Dependencies

-   ROS 2 Humble
-   Gazebo
-   Python 3
-   `turtlebot3`, `turtlebot3_msgs`, `turtlebot3_simulations` (cloned manually from source)

Install core ROS 2 dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  ros-humble-rclpy \
  ros-humble-geometry-msgs \
  ros-humble-sensor-msgs \
  ros-humble-nav-msgs \
  ros-humble-visualization-msgs \
  ros-humble-std-msgs
```

🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository


Create a workspace and clone this repository along with the required TurtleBot3 packages.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/const_ws/src
cd ~/const_ws/src

# Clone this repository
# Clone custom DWA planner
git clone https://github.com/ashtalekar36/dwa_custom_planner.git

# Clone required TurtleBot3 packages
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
```
2. Install ROS 2 Dependencies
Navigate to your workspace root and let rosdep install any remaining dependencies.
```bash
cd ~/const_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
3. Build the Workspace
Build the packages using colcon and source the setup file.
```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```
(Optional) Add the source command to your .bashrc for convenience:
```bash
echo "source ~/const_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
4. Set TurtleBot3 Model
Export the TURTLEBOT3_MODEL environment variable. This project uses burger.
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
```
(Optional) Add this to your .bashrc as well:
```bash
echo "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger" >> ~/.bashrc
```
📡 Running the Simulation
Launch the entire simulation environment with a single command:
```bash
ros2 launch custom_dwa dwa_planner_launch.py
```
 This will:

Launch Gazebo with the custom world.

Start RViz with a pre-configured layout.

Spawn the TurtleBot3 in the simulation.

Run the custom DWA local planner node.

🕹️ Usage Instructions
Wait for Gazebo and RViz to fully load.

In the RViz window, use the "2D Nav Goal" tool from the top toolbar to click on a destination.

The robot will begin moving towards the goal.

The robot will sample velocity commands (v,
omega), evaluate trajectories to find an obstacle-free path, and publish the best command to /cmd_vel. It will stop upon reaching the goal or if it becomes blocked.
Visualization Tools
Monitor Velocity Commands: You can inspect the planner's output in a separate terminal:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel
```
RViz Markers: The planner publishes the sampled trajectories as a MarkerArray, which can be visualized in RViz to see how the robot is making its decisio
